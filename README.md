PermutationGenerator
===
A performance analysis project that compares basic recursive combination generation against optimized library
implementations. The project includes a C++ implementation using manual recursive algorithms and a Python implementation
leveraging the highly-optimized itertools.combinations() library. Both implementations run identical test cases ranging
from simple combinations to extreme scenarios.

## Notes
This project was written as part of the Masters in Computer Science course "Bioinformatics" at
the University of the Bío-Bío.
